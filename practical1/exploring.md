## Step 2: exploring the functionalities
In this practical we will be exploring the datasets and functionalities of Google Earth Engine.


### Exercise 1: loading the biome map of the world and exploring its values

Now that we know more or less how it looks, let's use it. 
If at any point your lost on the basic JavaScript commands, go [back](https://cagecode.github.io/WFE-practicals/practical1/intro.html)

> Starting to build the script: exploring the Biome map 

Copy this piece of code in the 'script' panel of the earth engine GUI. 

```javascript

// first we retrieve the Image (the raster dataset) from the server and declare the variable
var biomes = ee.Image("OpenLandMap/PNV/PNV_BIOME-TYPE_BIOME00K_C/v01");

// but what have we done exactly? Let's see what it is in this 'Image'. 
print(biomes);

```

Save the file (e.g. name it 'BiomePlotting') and run it. 


> üîç **Recap 4**. You should see some basic information about the image *printed* in the console: how many bands does this Image have? (tip: try clicking on the Image name in the console) <br />
> <br />
> a) 1. <br />
> b) 5. <br />
> c) 8. <br />
> d) 16. <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 4.</summary>
Answer A. There is only one band available. This indicates that the Biome map consists of a single raster layer, meaning there are no multiple bands present. In contrast, for other types of data, such as average temperature per month, you would typically expect to see 12 bands ‚Äî one raster layer for each month.

> Exercise 2: plotting the biome map on the baselayer map and discovering its values


Now that we know (more or less) which Map we have loaded (for more info, you can always search the searchbar on top of the GUI), let's plot the map: 


```javascript
// First we need to define how we want to handle the visualisation: we need to *declare a variable* that describes how/what we want to plot. 
var visualization = {
  bands: ['biome_type'],
  min: 1.0,
  max: 32.0,
  palette: [
    "1c5510","659208","ae7d20","000065","bbcb35","009a18",
    "caffca","55eb49","65b2ff","0020ca","8ea228","ff9adf",
    "baff35","ffba9a","ffba35","f7ffca","e7e718","798649",
    "65ff9a","d29e96",
  ]
};


//after we have set the parameters for the visualisation (declared through the variable 'visualization'we can actually plot: 
Map.setCenter(4,53,7);
Map.addLayer(biomes, visualization, "Potential distribution of biomes");

```

<br />

> üîç **Recap 5**. Why is the minimum set at 1, and the maximum at 32? (hint: check the properties)? <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 5.</summary>
If you look in the properties, you will see 20 different classes. However, underneath 'biome_type_class_values' you will see that the data ranges from 1 (index 0) to 32 (index 19).
</details>
<br />

> üîç **Recap 6**. What does the palette do? (hint: try changing some of the letters in these strings)? <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 6.</summary>
The palette colors the different biome types, of which there are 20.
</details>
<br />

> üîç **Recap 7**. Try clicking on the biome map in the visualisation of the bottom panel: what happens underneath the tab: 'Inspector'? <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 7.</summary>
The inspector shows the value of the raster cell for the visualized map. You are thus 'inspecting' the raster.
</details>
<br />


#### TIP: for each of the functions, there is a documentation provided by earth-engine: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs

***
<br />

It‚Äôs time to explore the Biome map and answer the first few questions on Canvas. You can find these questions in the quiz associated with this practical.

> üìù **Question 1**. You have used the OpenLandMap/PNV/PNV_BIOME-TYPE_BIOME00K_C/v01 dataset to make a biome map of the world.
> What is the dominant pixel value in the Netherlands? <br />
> (tip: click on some pixels in the Netherlands on the map and then check the value in the 'inspector' panel on the right)

<br />


Now that you know the basic functionalities of the GUI (Graphical User Interface), let's try an actual application. Continue with step 3!
